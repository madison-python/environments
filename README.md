# Just python environments

**Developer environments from behind a veil of ignorance**

In _A Theory of Justice_, the moral philosopher John Rawls proposed a theory
that some issues should be decided from behind a "veil of ignorance". From
behind this veil, a person knows the consequences of an action, but does not
know how they personally might be affected. Rawles argued that actions taken
from behind this veil are just.

For Madpy this month, I will propose a theory of **just python environments**.
My plan is to show how I setup a clean install of a MacBook Pro for python
development, and talk about my "lessons learned" with various tools. I will do
my best to defend my decisions to use `brew`, `pyenv`, `pipenv`, and `pytest`,
but I'm sure there will be a healthy discussion! For the demo, I'll complete
one of the test-driven development exercises I've been doing at work.
